            "content": "Bio: . Christof Koch is a leading voice in Neurobiology/Neuroscience, and generally in the study of consciousness. He is the president of the CSO of the Allen Institute for Brain Science. . Definitions of Consciousness . In this interview, Christof challenges the definition of what defines consciousness. The challenge is that an individual can only know that they themselves are conscious. They will have to trust that others are as conscious well, and that they are not simply simulating conscious behavior. Because of this, common understanding is limited and we have no way to know the extent of consciousness. We rely on communication to show others that we are conscious ourselves. . There are a range of theories that ascribe consciousness to all matter, and theories that only ascribe it to humans, Christof thinks the theory that all living beings have consciousness is more reasonable. Whatever your definition of consciousness is, there currently is no way to validate whether or not an animal or plant meets your criteria. . Christof summarizes consciousness as the ability to experience. He explains that physics defines the relationships between the components of reality, but it says nothing about what the experience of being a prokaryote cell is like. To experience physics, to experience life as a being is consciousness for Christof (disclaimer: this is my interpretation, I&#39;m sure his definition is much more nuanced). The Theory of Integrated Information says that a system that has an internal causal power feels like something - no matter how simple the system appears. . He primarily challenges that the common delineation of conscious vs non-conscious beings is whether or not they can talk. Common understanding stakes that humans are the only conscious beings, and this is a common idea throughout religion that the human race is the chosen race by God. This conclusion requires the premise that consciousness requires the ability to talk or articulate thoughts and feelings. If this premise does not stand, then we cannot conclude definitively that plants are unconscious organisms. To attack this premise, Christof sites examples of humans exhibiting conscious behavior without communication. He tells of a man who is paralyzed except for his eyeballs, and who was able to write a book simply through the movement of his eyeballs. With Brain Machine Interfaces, there are ways to determine that if a fully-paralyzed or &quot;locked-in state&quot; human can still experiencing something. Additionally, conscious behavior is experienced in the REM dream state - we can feel intense emotions when dreaming about our long-gone dog or family member. Yet, these conscious experiences are internal, they do not require the human body or communication to another human to prove. Also, Christof sites a spiritual experience he had in a floatation tank (which I am also a big fan of) where all ideas of body, space, time, and mind slowly drift away, and all he was left with was conscious experience. His main point is that consciousness is centered around the ability to experience reality, and should not be defined based on the ability of a being to communicate their consciousness with others. . Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) . When talking about AGI and conscious algorithms, Christof provides an analogy where one can code a black hole in a computer program by using Einstein&#39;s and other astrophysics theories. Yet when the computer program is run, the programmer doesn’t get sucked into the black hole. The computer is only simulating a black hole, it is not truly a black hole and therefore is not experiencing what it is like to be a black hole. The same applies to consciousness and intelligence - currently computers can only simulate these things, they have no ability to experience. . If we create a super-intelligent AI system (close to AGI), we want this to be conscious in order to integrate with humans and be empathetic to their cause. Without empathy, algorithms will run according to utility functions, which are potentially detrimental to humans. It may be best for the economy to kill everyone&#39;s dogs for whatever reason, and AI wouldn&#39;t see a reason why not to do it. . Christof laughs at the Simulation Hypothesis, calling it the &quot;Rapture for Nerds&quot;. It&#39;s just another evolution of the philosophical question that&#39;s been around forever - are we in the mind of God? It&#39;s esoteric and there is no way to validate, so it is a futile question to ask. . Religion and Consciousness . Christof&#39;s philosophy aligns most closely with Buddhism (minus reincarnation), mainly he believes in minimizing the suffering of all beings. Buddhism holds consciousness as primary and superior to both the mind and the ego, and it focusses on experiencing life rather than judging it and ascribing ego to it. . When asked about the existence of free will, he explains that complete free will is never possible because of the pre-conditioned algorithms and sub-conscious decision making that is continually occuring within the individual. One has the free will to work at changing these algorithms (Carl Jung&#39;s &quot;Shadow Work&quot;), but there will never be a full escape. Instead, free will is most closely experienced during intense decision making (buying a house, changing jobs, etc.). . Feature or Bug - Human&#39;s inability to understand the subconscious? It&#39;s a feature because of the depth of information processing required to move forward in the world - we have to be conscious when learning, but then we need to automate responses in the long run (such as typing) to save energy and function semi-productively. It seems like a bug that we don&#39;t have the ability to wipe traumatic memories, but if we had this ability it&#39;d likely result in using it too much, which would be destructive in the end. . Next Steps . For a student aspiring to enter this field of study: . Study at the intersection of Cognitive Behavioral Science, Philosophy of Mind, and AI disciplines. . For Christof: . There is an area in the brain called the cloud storm, which receives input from every cortical area, and projects outputs back to every cortical area - similar to a conductor in a symphony. It is one of the structures in which the individual parts construct the whole of the experience. Christof is excited to study it through his neuron-reconstruction project and understand how this mechanism relates to consciousness. .",

            "content": "The Machine Learner &#8211; Introduction . What attracts me to data science? . Problem solving has always been my greatest strength. In school I enjoyed and excelled at math, but as I took math classes in college, I realized that I didn’t care to get deeper into theoretical concepts – I wanted to solve real world problems. Luckily, the same semester that I gave up my pursuit of Actuarial Science, Notre Dame announced they’d be launching a new Business Analytics major for my class. I gave it a try after enjoying my first IT/Excel class and was quickly confident that I had made the right choice. . Before any analytics started, I quickly began to enjoy coding. One learns Spanish for communication purposes, but one learns the Python language for problem-solving purposes. This concept still fascinates me – with human language I can at most communicate to 7 billion people, but with code I can not only communicate with, but control (essentially) infinite computers. Humans are tool-using creatures, and computer coding is likely the greatest tool that has ever been available to man. . The hook went deeper when I began predictive analytics. As a kid I always fought to be right in every argument with my sisters. Then in high school, I became obsessed with fantasy football and was very entertained by the idea of predicting a player&#39;s output and then competing with a friend to prove that my predictions were better than there&#39;s. My introduction to predictive analytics played perfectly to this crave, and I found it quite exciting to optimize my decision-making power. Relying on data and state-of-the-art algorithms is much more effective for making predictions than are gut feelings or emotional decision making. . As I matured and went through college, I became very interested in the pursuit of truth. If &quot;truth&quot; from a philosophical perspective indeed exists, then no human can ever fully approach or capture it - no matter how intelligent or wise. Machine&#39;s likely will never capture pure &quot;truth&quot; either, but they will be able to collect and interpret data on nearly all facets of human life and the natural world. With processing power and tools such as deep learning, AI will be better able to understand the world than any network of humans has to date. My university curriculum barely scraped the bottom of deep learning, but I got just enough of a taste to fuel my desire to continue learning and developing my ML skills. . What fuels your passion for Machine Learning today? . I love making predictions when looking forward, but when looking backward I am constantly interpreting the world through the lens of evolution and natural selection. Some of my favorite books are Darwin’s The Origin of Species, and Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens, Homo Deus, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century. The many successive evolutions leading humans from hunter-gathers to smart-phone junkies have each completely altered the lives of all, changing the way societies and economies operate, changing how people view the world, how people interact with each other. . The more I read, experience, and learn about machine learning, the more confidently I know that ML will be as impactful to the evolution of society as were the printing press, the automobile, and the internet. When ML knows me better than I know myself, and when ML is able to automate most jobs in the economy, we will be living in a completely new world - one that is impossible to understand, and one that requires a massive shift of norms. . ML/AI will come to dominate every industry, and it will change every facet of individual lifestyles, international economies, culture and religion, and global community. In the past, jobs replaced by new technologies have been replaced with newly created jobs. When the agricultural industry was largely automated away, the accounting profession surged in supply to offset it. There is no way to be certain how the job market will be affected by AI and Machine Learning, but we can be certain that these technologies will replace human intelligence, while in the past technologies have only replaced human labor. When this barrier is crossed, I genuinely believe there cannot be enough new jobs to be found elsewhere. If there are new jobs to be found, they will likely be replaced shortly themselves. . This evolution will occur exponentially quicker than any other previous evolution. With the popularization of the internet and smart-phones, we all experienced a subtle but rapid shift in our everyday lives. One day we were living normal lives, focused on our surroundings, and ten years later we are all densely connected to the internet and each other, and we forget that life wasn’t like this until very recently. There is no alien ship that is going to land on Earth and change everything in a single point of time - these technological changes are viewed as alien now, but when they &quot;land&quot; they do so very quietly and slowly, becoming a greater and greater influence on the average person&#39;s life until it becomes the only life they know. How long could you go without your smartphone? How long could you go without the internet? . Given the current trajectory, we need to begin thinking about the implications today. How will education change when the job market has need for less and less humans? How will third world economies be affected when their jobs are automated away by Western technology companies? How will individuals be compensated for their data, which serves as fuel for the machines that have replaced their jobs? . Machine learning is inevitably going to improve to a point where it will run the entire world - for the most part it already is today. This revolution will be unnoticeable to most people, and until the government becomes more educated in data and computer science, this revolution will be led by a small group of top data scientists. There are many very good use cases of ML - currently third world countries average one doctor for every ten that are needed by the people, and AI appears to be the solution to provide this medical care and knowledge that is extremely lacking across the globe. Given the strength of my core data science, my passion for predictive models, and my foresight of the evolution to come, I strongly feel that it is my duty to become a part of this evolution and direct it toward good. . How do you plan to act on this passion and master Machine Learning? . With the depth of resources and communities available for self-learning online, I think the best route to ML mastery is through a Masters or PHD, but to take online courses, compete in competitions, and read research papers habitually. I found my undergraduate education in data science to be very effective and essential for building my passion and confidence, but from here I feel confident that everything I learned in undergrad, I could have learned through a structured system of online courses and competitions. In fact, most of my curriculum and class projects were recycled Kaggle competitions - the only benefit was having a TA and office hours, which GitHub, Stack Overflow, and hopefully one mentor will make up for. I am confident that I can conduct my own Masters program and that my commitment to it will result in a stronger skillset than being hand-fed the same curriculum at a slower pace, and with more distractions. Luckily, the nature of data science competitions lends itself to proving one&#39;s skills through model performance rankings, rather than grades or a piece of paper. Hopefully, my choice to institute my own mastery program, and the results that will show in competitions will prove my passion and effectiveness to future employers. . I plan to use this blog to hold me accountable to this self-driven path, and to force me to pause and absorb my recent lessons, articulate my fresh thoughts, and hopefully help a few youngsters beginning their ML journey. . In summary... . I am highly motivated to become a data science master and I plan to set out on a career-long journey of continual education, and continual investment. This is fueled by my fascination with optimizing decisions and by my foresight into the power the ML will unleash in the years to come. I see the changes in the world that ML will cause, and I want to be a force of good to guide or influence this incoming revolution. . Thanks for reading! .",
